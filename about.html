  <p>I am a soon to be graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's Degree in Game Design and Development.</p>
  <p>A passionate developer with prior internship experience working with the development for websites and web apps for makeithappen.nyc, primarily working front-end, I am a 
    logical problem solver with technical and analytical skills! I have a clear understanding of design goals for user interface and experience and have worked 
    with game engines in the past as well. My main languages are Javascript, C#, and C++. </p>
  <p>Most of my prior game projects are done in Unity / Unreal and I'm interested in software
    development and game development roles as well. I aspire in the future to be a standalone developer, but right now I am pursuing jobs in software and web development to gain experience
    and refine my knowledge whilst working.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions regarding my past experience, feel free to <a class = "link" href = "contact.html">contact me!</a></p>
