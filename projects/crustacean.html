      <p>A puzzle game coded with some team members of a class that utilizes the gimmick of locked movement for only one axis for the two user-controlled player crabs. Created with
        the Unity engine, and coded in C#. 
      </p>
      <p>For the creation of this game, I handled menu interface logic, menu interface designs, scene transition logic, and wrote game logic for the locked
        player movement, as well as helping other members of the team after I finished these tasks. A year after the creation of this game, 
        I decided to revisit the project and added all the sounds and music to the game using FMOD studio and Reaper to manipulate audio. 
        I also added new features like crab sprinting and the volume settings.</p>
